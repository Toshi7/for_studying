# .Net Core

## Goals

- Take the course from [Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://mva.microsoft.com/) to learn .Net Core and check if MVA covers everything for people who are going to develop using .Net Core or not.
If not, then write down which part it doesn't cover.
- Also, check another websites to learn .Net Core and compare which one is better.

## [Introduction to .NET Core](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/introduction-to-net-core-16764?l=DoVafl7yC_7606218965)
This introduction of .Net Core video is provided on MVA.
It mainly covers 5 things below
- Installation
- Command Line Tools
- Unit Testing
- Using Visual Studio
- Mixing .Net Core with other .Net projects  
This is really useful for people who just start learning .Net Core.
However, it didn't explain about how to connect to GitHub to push and pull.
So, I explain how to do it step by step in this link below
