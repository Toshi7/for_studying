# .Net Core

## Goals

- Take the course from [Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://mva.microsoft.com/) to learn .Net Core and check if MVA covers everything for people who are going to develop using .Net Core or not.
If not, then write down which part it doesn't cover.
- Also, check another websites to learn .Net Core and compare which one is better.
