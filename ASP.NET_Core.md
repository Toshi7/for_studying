ASP.NET Core
=====================================

What is ASP.NET Core ?
-------------------------------------
> ASP.NET Core is a new open-source and cross-platform framework for building modern cloud based internet connected applications, such as web apps, IoT apps and mobile backends. ASP.NET Core apps can run on .NET Core or on the full .NET Framework. It was architected to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are deployed to the cloud or run on-premises. It consists of modular components with minimal overhead, so you retain flexibility while constructing your solutions. You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core apps cross-platform on Windows, Mac and Linux. ASP.NET Core is open source at [GitHub](https://github.com/aspnet/home).

## Web Servers  
- IIS Express 
  - IIS Express is the default web server for web application projects in Visual Studio 2012 and Visual Studio 2013, and it is recommended for both web application projects and web site projects.
- Local IIS
  - Use IIS when you want to test your web application using the server environment that is closest to what the live site will run under, and it is practical for you to install and work with IIS on your development computer. For more information, see Disadvantages of Using IIS as a Development Server with Visual Studio later in this topic.
You can use IIS with web application projects, but not with web site projects.
- External Host
  - You can specify the URL of an external host that you will use for testing. For more information, see Advantages of using an External Host as a Development Server with Visual Studio later in this topic.
- Custom Web Server
  - Visual Studio 2013 adds support for specifying custom Web servers in your projects; this functionality enables developers to define the environment for testing their Web applications.
