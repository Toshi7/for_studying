DDD(Domain Driven Design)
=====================================

What is DDD(Domain Driven Design) ?
-------------------------------------
Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to software development for complex needs by connecting the implementation to an evolving model.[1] The premise of domain-driven design is the following:

- placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic;
- basing complex designs on a model of the domain;
- initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.
