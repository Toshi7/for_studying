## Why Livet ? 
- It covers weakness point of MVVM. 

## What is MVVM ?
- It is the Model, View, ViewModel (MVVM pattern) which helps you to organize and structure your code to write maintainable, testable and extensible
- **Model**: It simply holds the data and has nothing to do with any of the business logic.
- **ViewModel**: It acts as the link/connection between the Model and ViewModel and makes
stuff look pretty.
- **View**: It simply holds the formatted date and essentially delegates everything to the
Model.

## Good things
- There is a Livet-specific Message system
  - Easy to send view notification from ViewModel
- Since  Base of ViewModel is ready for you, easy to change the notification of property
- There is code sup- port assistance for property / commands (there is also Prism)
- Behaviors are provided as standard
  - (e.g. PasswordBoxBindingSupportBehavior)
  
## Bad things 
- Because Japaese developer are developing this, the libraries are written in Japanese 
- This is not ofen used in overseas, so there are not many sources online.
