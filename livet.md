## What is MVVM ?
- It is the Model, View, ViewModel (MVVM pattern) which helps you to organize and structure your code to write maintainable, testable and extensible
- **Model**: It simply holds the data and has nothing to do with any of the business logic.
- **ViewModel**: It acts as the link/connection between the Model and ViewModel and makes
stuff look pretty.
- **View**: It simply holds the formatted date and essentially delegates everything to the
Model.
